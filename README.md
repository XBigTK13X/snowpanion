## Disclaimer

Snowpanion does not provide a digital implementation of any board game. It only provides a companion to use alongside a retail copy of a board game. All game names and artwork are copyright their respective owners.

## Supported Games

[See the WIKI entry on supported games.](https://github.com/XBigTK13X/snowpanion/wiki/Supported-Games)

## Goals

For the moment, only solo play companions are planned. I can see a place for things like the Robots expansion from Power Grid for multiplayer companions in the future.
