# Snowpanion

Run board game automa without the fiddly bits.

## Copyrights

Snowpanion does not provide a digital implementation of any board game. It only provides a companion to use alongside a retail copy of a board game. All game names and artwork are copyright their respective owners.

## Supported Games

- Welcome To (work in progress)
- Wingspan (planned)
- Hadrian's Wall (planned)
- Fleet: The Dice Game (planned)

## Goals

For the moment, only solo play companions are planned. I can see a place for things like the Robots expansion from Power Grid for multiplayer companions in the future.
