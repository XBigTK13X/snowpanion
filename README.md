## Supported Games

[See the WIKI entry on supported games.](https://github.com/XBigTK13X/snowpanion/wiki/Supported-Games)

## Goals

For the moment, only solo play companions are planned. I can see a place for things like the Robots expansion from Power Grid for multiplayer companions in the future.
